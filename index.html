      <h1>MUSIC370 FINAL: LOVE(-ADJACENT)</h1>
      <h2>By Jane Plomp</h2>
      <p>Here is a collection of songs written and produced for my music 370
        class. The theme I went with was "Love(-Adjacent)". I like to write
        songs that I haven't heard before, and since love songs are so
        pervasive I tend to shy away from writing those. However, I think there
        are a lot of things I love and things that relate to love which are
        worth exploring, so I used love and love-adjacent subjects
        as an overarching theme.</p>

      <h3>Hungry Kitty</h3>

      <p>This is for my cat, Chaz, who I love. There's a small section in dutch
        since some of my family members occasionally speak to her in that
        language. I had a dutch consultant (AKA my father) help me with the written
        lyrics, but please forgive imperfections in my pronounciation. The meows
        are all done by me, doing my very best impressions of Chaz.</p>

      <h3>Better For You</h3>
      <audio controls>

      </audio>
      <p>I've never had a messy break-up, but I love break-up/diss/revenge
        songs.</p>

      <h3>Mothman</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Mothman_05-16-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>I've included Mothman in this project because I think he deserves
        more love. Everyone goes on about Bigfoot/Sasquatch, Nessie, etc.,
        but Mothman is among the most charming cryptids I'm aware
        of. If you want to understand the "tight behind" line, search up images
        of the Mothman statue in West Virginia.</p>

      <h3>Measure my Love</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Measure_my_Love_05-17-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>The closest thing to a true love song in this collection, though it's
        more about love of quantification than necessarily love for a person.
        Ultimately the entire song is an excuse to use the line "I turn into
        experimental data when I look into your eyes."</p>

      <h3>The Swarm </h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/The_Swarm_05-16-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>This song came to me in a dream. Specifically, a nightmare where I was
        presenting my progress to the class on this project, and when I tried to
        play "Mothman" this played instead. Well, not exactly this. The dream
        version was much gentler, but I ended up composing a creepier version.
        I love bees, which makes it fit with the theme of this project, but
        unfortunately this song presents bees as a little bit scary.</p>

      <h3>Nice Guy</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Nice_Guy_05-17-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>This song has a lot of vulgar language. If you are a child, please skip
        it. I don't love nice guys (not the type that I critique in this
        song, anyway) but I think their misogyny sometimes comes from their
        belief that they love women. This was brewed up during a particularly
        long shower I took when I was stewing on misogyny.</p>

      <h1>PREVIOUS PROJECTS FOR THIS CLASS</h1>
      <p>I've written various other pieces for this class, though not
        specifically for this project. If you're curious about other works
        I've made, here they are:</p>
      <h2>O-Robot</h2>
      <p>This project theme was stumbled upon a little bit by accident... I
        started with "Override", then happened to read about the Mars rover
        Opportunity dying and felt inspired to write "Opportunity". Upon
        reflection, I discovered I wrote two songs about robots starting with
        the letter "O". Two songs feels like a weird coincidence, so
        I wanted a third to make it a proper theme. That's when "0281-Wife"
        popped up, and although a zero is not exactly an "O", I pronounce it as
        an "O" in the song.</p>

      <h3>Opportunity</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Opportunity.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>The inspiration for this piece was, obviously, the Mars rover
        Opportunity. I'd like if there were more serenades to real life
        robots.</p>

      <h3>Override</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Override_revised_05-16-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>I debated on the line "More than a man, more than machine" for a long
        time. The alternative would have used "More than human..." which I
        normally prefer because of its inclusiveness. However, I personally
        relate to many robot stories that explore marginalization through my
        experiences as a woman. Because a woman sings this song, using the word
        "man" calls more attention to gender, and gives it a bonus message
        about a woman being greater than the men who have oppressed her.</p>
      <h3>0281-Wife</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/0281-Wife.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>The theme of womanhood and fighting marginalization is a little more
        explicit in this narrative song. I love songs that tell a story, and
        this is a funky sci-fi sort of story with a big pro-robot message.
        I started this song during the same shower when I thought up
        "Nice Guy". It was just one of those days.</p>

      <h2>MUSIC270 Projects</h2>
      <p>Music 270 was the prereq to this class, and I made some other songs
        in that class as well. Please forgive the quality, they are
        among my first forays into audio production.</p>

      <h3>Catching Spools</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/jplomp_Project_2.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>This was made after we learned how to make synths in Logic.</p>

      <h3>Sally Runs</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/jplomp_Sally_Runs_05-17-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>The first draft of this song only lasted 3 minutes or so, but the
        assignment suggested a length of "5-10 min." So I did what anyone would
        do: Doubled the length of the verses and added dialogue sections. Since
        it's a narrative song, it worked out. Also it gave me the
        chance to put in some fun sound effects. </p>
