      <h1>MUSIC370 FINAL: LOVE(-ADJACENT)</h1>
      <h2>By Jane Plomp</h2>
      <p>Here is a collection of songs written and produced for my music 370
        class. The theme I went with was "Love(-Adjacent)". I like to write
        songs that I haven't heard before, and since love songs are so
        pervasive I tend to shy away from writing those. However, I think there
        are a lot of things I love and things that relate to love in different
        ways that can be explored, so I used love and love-adjacent subjects
        as an overarching theme.</p>

      <h3>Hungry Kitty</h3>

      <p>This is for my cat, Chaz, who I love. There's a small section in dutch
        since some of my family members occasionally speak to her in that
        language. I had a dutch consultant (my dad) help me with the written
        lyrics, but please forgive imperfections in my pronounciation.</p>

      <h3>Better For You</h3>

      <p>I've never had a messy break-up, but I love break-up/diss/revenge songs.</p>

      <h3>Mothman</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Mothman_05-16-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>I've included Mothman in this project because I think he deserves
        more love. Honestly though, everyone goes on about bigfoot, sasquatch,
        nessie, etc., but mothman is among the most charming cryptids I'm aware
        of.</p>

      <h3>Measure my Love</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Measure_my_Love_05-16-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>The closest thing to a true love song in this collection, though it's
        more about love of quantification than necessarily love for a person.</p>

      <h3>The Swarm </h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/The_Swarm_05-16-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>This song came to me in a dream. Specifically, a nightmare where I was
        presenting my progress to the class on this project, and when I tried to
        play "Mothman" this played instead. Well, not exactly this. The dream
        version was much gentler, but I ended up composing a creepier version.
        I love bees, which makes it fit with the theme of this project, but
        unfortunately this song presents bees as a little bit scary.</p>

      <h3>Nice Guy</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Nice_guy_05-16-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>This song has a lot of vulgar language. If you are a child, please skip
        this song. I don't love nice guys (not the type that I critique in this
        song, anyway) but I think their misogyny sometimes comes from their
        belief that they love women.</p>

      <h1>PREVIOUS PROJECTS FOR THIS CLASS</h2>
      <p>I've written various other pieces for this class, though not
        specifically for this project. If you're curious about other works
        I've made, here they are:</p>
      <h2>O-Robot</h2>
      <p>This project theme was stumbled upon a little bit by accident... I
        started with "Override", then happened to read about the Mars rover
        Opportunity dying and felt inspired to write "Opportunity". Upon
        reflection, I discovered I wrote two songs about robots starting with
        the letter "O". Two songs feels like just a coincidence, so
        I wanted a third to make it a proper theme. That's when "0281-Wife"
        popped up, and although a zero is not exactly an "O", I pronounce it as
        an "O" in the song.</p>

      <h3>Opportunity</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Opportunity.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>The inspiration for this piece was, obviously, the Mars rover
        Opportunity. I'd like if there were more serenades to real life
        robots.</p>

      <h3>Override</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Override_revised_05-16-19.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>I love that robot media is an opportunity to explore personhood.
        Although I use robots, I think there's a universal message of the sort
        of questioning one undergoes due to marginalization, a theme I
        personally relate to through womanhood. This song has a message of
        realizing one's own personhood and worth, despite being told otherwise.</p>
      <h3>0281-Wife</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/0281-Wife.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>The theme of womanhood and fighting marginalization is a little more
        explicit in this narrative song. I love songs that tell a story, and
        this is a funky sci-fi sort of story with a big pro-robot message.</p>
